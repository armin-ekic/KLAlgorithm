# KLAlgorithm

This goal of this algorithm is to take 2 files containing a netlist in hypergraph notation and component names/sizes, and optimally partition the set. This is an implementation of the KL algorithm, which is a greedy iterative improvement method.

Inputs:
  -when the main file (hyperMain.py) is ran, the user will be prompted to choose 2 files
  -the text files test.txt and test-are.txt are examples of the files that are needed as inputs
  -the files need to be chosen test.txt and test-are.txt in that order
  -at this point, the algorithm will do all the necessary computation
